# Product Catalog – Web Application

A lightweight and modular web application designed to manage and display a product catalog using semantic HTML, vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), and a clean project structure oriented to scalability and maintainability.

This project follows a professional development workflow with separate branches for development (`dev`) and production (`main`).

---

## Objectives

- Structure the application following clean architecture and modular organization.
- Separate concerns between markup, styles, and scripts.
- Apply professional Git workflow and commit conventions.
- Prepare the foundation for future features such as data parsing, filtering, and product search.

## Tech Stack

- HTML5 (semantic structure)
- CSS3 (modular styles)
- JavaScript ES6+ (vanilla, no frameworks)

---

## Project Structure

/src
/assets → images and static resources
/styles → CSS stylesheets
/scripts → JavaScript modules

- `main` → stable / production branch

All features are implemented in `dev` and merged into `main` when validated and ready for release.
